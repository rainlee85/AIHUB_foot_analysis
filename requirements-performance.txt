# Performance Optimization Dependencies (Optional)
# For users who want maximum speed with modern libraries

# Include base requirements
-r requirements.txt

# Polars for fast data operations (5-10x faster than Pandas)
polars>=0.19.0

# Taichi for GPU acceleration (2-4x faster with GPU)
taichi>=1.6.0

# Optional: PyArrow with optimized features
pyarrow[pandas]>=13.0.0

# Installation instructions:
# 1. Install base requirements first:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# 2. Install performance dependencies:
#    pip install -r requirements-performance.txt
#
# 3. Verify installations:
#    python -c "import polars as pl; print(f'Polars {pl.__version__}')"
#    python -c "import taichi as ti; ti.init(arch=ti.gpu); print('Taichi GPU ready')"
#
# Expected improvements:
# - Data loading: 5-10x faster (Polars)
# - Statistical computations: 2-4x faster with GPU (Taichi)
# - Overall pipeline: 1.5-2x faster combined
#
# Compatibility:
# - Polars: Backward compatible (falls back to Pandas)
# - Taichi: Auto-detects GPU, falls back to CPU
# - Both optional - scripts work without them
