# GPU-Accelerated Dependencies (Optional)
# For users with NVIDIA/AMD GPUs who want maximum performance

# Include base requirements
-r requirements.txt

# Taichi for GPU acceleration
taichi>=1.6.0

# Optional: CUDA toolkit integration (if using NVIDIA)
# Note: CUDA must be installed separately on the system
# cupy-cuda11x>=12.0.0  # Uncomment for CUDA 11.x
# cupy-cuda12x>=12.0.0  # Uncomment for CUDA 12.x

# Installation instructions:
# 1. Install base requirements first:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# 2. Install GPU dependencies:
#    pip install -r requirements-gpu.txt
#
# 3. Verify Taichi GPU support:
#    python -c "import taichi as ti; ti.init(arch=ti.gpu); print('GPU ready!')"
#
# Expected speedup with GPU:
# - 50 patients:  5-10 minutes (vs 20-30 min CPU)
# - 700 patients: 30-60 minutes (vs 2-3 hours CPU)
# - 2-4x faster than Numba CPU-only mode
